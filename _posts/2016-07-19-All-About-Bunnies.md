Awesome! That bunny looks great.

Things I love about bunnies:

- They are great at doing taxes
- They never, ever, complain about splitting the bill evenly
- They're always down to binge-watch anything, even The West Wing

Famous quotes by famous bunnies:

> I'd love to be animated. I've always wanted to jump off of a bridge and not be hurt, like Bugs Bunny.

\- Carrot Top
